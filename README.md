# **Tic Tac Toe App**

---

This App was developed as an assignment to demostrate the usage of **OOP** using **Ruby on Rails**.

### Specifications

> Write your own tic-tac-toe application. The application must be object orientated and tested. This is an open-ended exercise to write tested and testable code. Donâ€™t spend more than three hours.

### Descrption

The app is based on the famous game **Tic Tac Toe**. If the game is played well there will be always a draw. 

In this application was used **ActionCable** a feature from the newest **Rails 5**  which allow us to use a websocket. 
This approach integrate also the usage of **Redis**. 
The reason behind this method is becasue the app is thought to be played from 2 players. The idea is that we use a channale to broadcast message in real-time and everyone which is on lisneting wiil then receive the message. 
In the app case we have 2 players playing via two different browser pages and both players see the game grid. When a player take a move, in our case putting an X or O inside the grid. This move is broadcasteed to the second player which see in real-time the move. Then the player which has turn does the same and then again the move is broadcasted.
The methodology allow us to make this possible.

- Rails 5.2.1
- PostgresSQL
- Redis

### Run The App

1. Clone the repo to desired folder
2. Run in terminal **bundle install**
3. Make sure **PSQL** and **Redis** are running
4. Run in terminal **rails db:create** and then **rails db:migrate**
5. Run **rails s** to run the application
6. Open the browser at **localhost:3000** to be able to play open anothe browser at the same URL and enjoy playing
